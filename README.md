# ESP32-HUB75-Scrolling-Text
An ESP32 project to drive a chain of HUB75 RGB LED matrix panels. This code uses the ESP32-HUB75-MatrixPanel-I2S-DMA library to efficiently display scrolling text across four 32x32 panels. It demonstrates a basic setup for creating a smooth, horizontally scrolling marquee display, perfect for information boards or decorative signs.
